# Render Tree


The Lightning Render Tree can be considered *similar* to the HTML DOM Render Tree, because:

* In both Render Trees, you can define the [elements](Elements/index.md) to be shown and how these elements are positioned and rendered.
* You can set the properties of these elements to change the way they are displayed.


Still, the Lightning Render Tree is completely *different* from the HTML DOM Render Tree, because:

* The Lightning Render Tree is entirely written in JavaScript.
* It includes a completely different and more basic API (method) set.
* It is defined through [templates](../Templates/index.md).
* It has a dynamic character.
