# Components


Components are added to your App's [template](../Templates/index.md) to make them reusable and extendable throughout the App.


The usual flow is as follows:

1. [Create components](CompCreation.md) including instances to your template, and pass the necessary parameters to them.
2. Add [lifecycle events](LifecycleEvents.md) to add logic to your App.
3. Define [component states](CompStates/index.md) to keep track of what your App is doing at a certain state.
